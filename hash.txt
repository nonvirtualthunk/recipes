1 1/2 lb russet potatoes
2 Tbsp vinegar
1 lb chorizo rojo
1 lb bacon
[ just one or the other is also fine ]
1/2 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp paprika
6 scallions, main part cut in chunks, greens sliced thin
1 poblano pepper, cut into chunks
4 large eggs (theoretically)
cilantro
avocado

Preheat oven to 375

Cut potatoes into 1/2" pieces and cover with water. Add vinegar, bring to a boil then reduce to simmer for ~5ish minutes or until somewhat tender. Drain.

Cook up chorizo and/or bacon. Add potatoes to the fat and cook for ~20 minutes, flipping occasionally. Add spices and cook for 30 more seconds. Remove to bowl.

Add poblano and scallion chunks to pan, cook stirring infrequently until charred.

Strain eggs to remove runniest parts.

Combine potatoes, veggies, meat into pan. Add eggs on top. Cook for 10 minutes.
